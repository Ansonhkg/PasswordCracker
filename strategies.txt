To generate password guesses, I have 5 filter in my filter class

1) To find of there is EXACT match
2) Convert all words into universal leet, for example, a=4,e=3,g=6, etc.
3) Reverse all the words, Example 12345 -> 54321
4) Capitalize first letter
5) Concatenate a word in the dictionary with every other word. It's N^2, so if dictionary size is 10, then it will be 10x10 = 100 different possibilities
6) Concatenate all words from year 1900 to 2016.
7) Concatenate common number combinations, from 1, to 123456789. For example, apple1, apple12, apple123, .., apple123456789
8) Double words, for example, "blah" to "blahblah"
